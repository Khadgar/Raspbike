Raspbike
========

I'm a student of Computer Science. I like my bicycle so I would like to develop a bike computer system from Raspberry Pi called Raspbike.

You can already do a lot of things with smatphones. But they have a huge disadvantage: battery life.

Raspbike is going to be a built in small bike computer system with the following features:

- GPS tracking
- Speed/Odometer
- Calorie count
- Heart rate 
- Wireless communication
- Light management (front/rear, break, turn signal)

The power source of the Raspbike will be a battery which is chargeable with solar panel.

How it works?

1. If you have a smartphone you can connect it to the Raspbike via bluetooth. (No wires)
2. The Raspbike sends the processed information to the smatphone.

The software on the smatphone allows you to control the lights and synchronise your data when you are on the road.


Thanks for reading,
